{"name":"FASGuard","tagline":"automatic signature generator for intrusion detection systems","body":"# FASGuard (Framework for Automatic Signature Generation)\r\n\r\nFASGuard is designed to produce Snort rules from packets forwarded by anomaly detectors compliant with the FASGuard interface. FASGuard contains:\r\n* A FASGuard format interface for anomaly detectors to transmit packet and meta-data to the signature extraction module.\r\n* A reference host-peering anomaly detector which detects one type of anomaly and adheres to the FASGuard format interface.\r\n* An Automatic Signature Generation (ASG) module that incorporates three separate signature extraction algorithms:\r\n  - N-gram based signatures;\r\n  - Joined signatures which find regions of unique content in suspicious packets;\r\n  - Clustering-based signatures which can derive signatures from multiple instances of a polymorphic attack.\r\n* Bloom filter production code and utilities to support benign traffic characterization\r\n  - A per TCP/IP service n-gram storing Bloom filter module\r\n  - A Bloom filter combining utility was created.\r\n* Utilities to transmit rules to remote Snort/Suricata installations via STIX/TAXII","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
